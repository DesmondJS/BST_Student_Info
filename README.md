# Binary Search Tree Student Data

This repository contains a C++ program that implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) to manage student data read from a text file. The program supports various operations such as inserting student records, printing the deepest node, displaying students in different orders, cloning subtrees, printing nodes at specific levels, and printing paths in the tree.

## Features

- **Read student data from a text file**: The program reads student records from a specified text file and inserts them into the BST based on their student ID.
- **Insert records**: Inserts student records into the BST.
- **Print the deepest node**: Identifies and prints the deepest node in the BST.
- **Display students**: Displays student records on the screen or writes them to another text file in ascending or descending order.
- **Clone a subtree**: Creates a clone of a specified subtree within the BST.
- **Print level nodes**: Prints all nodes at a specific level of the BST.
- **Print paths**: Prints all paths from the root to the leaves in the BST.

## File Structure

- **app.cpp**: Contains the main logic of the program.
- **BST.cpp**: Contains the implementation of the BST and its operations.
- **BST.h**: Contains the declarations of the BST class and its member functions.
- **student.txt**: Sample text file containing student data for testing.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DesmondJS/BST_Student_Info.git

2. **Open the project in Visual Studio**
   - Open 'project1.sln' in Visual Studio

3. **Build and run the project**
   - Build the solution and run the project to execute the program
